My first molecular docking work as part of my Computer-Aided Drug Design Training (2024).

This repository contains one of the assignments where I performed docking analysis using the 3D structure of Amyloid Precursor Protein (PDB_ID:3UMI) 
with five selected phytochemicals (rutin, engeletin, myricetin, aspirin, and Paracetamol). All relevant images, the docking score table, and the interaction analysis are presented 
in the attached pdf.

=> Files included

- The PDF file – Full step-by-step assignment with docking process
- docking_result.png—Visualization of the docked complex (2D & 3D structure)

=> Software Used
- BIOVIA Discovery Studio
- PyRx and AutoDock Vina
- Swiss PDB viewer

=> Used Database
- RCSB Protein data bank
- PubChem database
