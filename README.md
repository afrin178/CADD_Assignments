My first molecular docking work as part of my Computer-Aided Drug Design Training (2024).

This repository contains one of the assignments where I performed docking analysis using the 3D structure of Amyloid Precursor Protein (PDB_ID:3UMI) 
with five selected phytochemicals (rutin, engeletin, myricetin, aspirin, and Paracetamol). All relevant images, the docking score table, and the interaction analysis are presented 
in the attached pdf.
